### **Roll the Dice, Take a Risk, and Outsmart Your Opponent!**

Farkle is a thrilling dice game that brings strategy and luck together in a fast-paced battle of wits. Players take turns rolling six dice, aiming to form high-scoring combinations and outplay their opponents. Will you play it safe or push your luck to the limit?  

## **Features:**
- Play dice games with NPC (innkeepers), just like in other RPGs.
- Challenge other players who have the addon installed and prove your skills.
- Choose the game duration: 2000 (~2 minutes), 4000 (~4 minutes), or 8000 (~8 minutes).

## Basic Rules:
The objective is simple: be the first to reach the target score by rolling six dice and setting aside high-value combinations. After each roll, you must decideâ€”bank your points or roll again for more! But beware: if you roll without scoring, you lose everything you've gained that turn.

The concept of the game was inspired by the dice game from **Kingdom Come: Deliverance**, featuring the same rules and scoring combinations.

**Farkle** is a passion project developed purely for fun, not as a professional endeavor. As such, the code may not be perfect and might contain workarounds to ensure features function correctly.
