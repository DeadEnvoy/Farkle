![](https://i.imgur.com/gqv1K6z.jpeg)

**Farkle** is a classic dice game where players take turns rolling six dice to score points by making combinations, aiming to reach a target score before their opponent.  

## **Current Features:**
- Playing against other players (addon owners).  
- Playing against NPCs (innkeepers), similar to other RPGs.  
- Safe Mode (uses /roll as the method for calculating dice roll results).

## **Rules ([EN](https://kingdom-come-deliverance.fandom.com/wiki/Dice)/[RU](https://tinyurl.com/bdheky4n)):**

The goal of the game is to score a certain number of points before your opponent. Participants take turns rolling 6 dice on the table. Then, they need to set aside some dice to form special combinations that earn points. At this stage, they can either end their turn or continue. Once all six dice have been set aside, they can roll all six again and keep going until there are no dice left that can be set aside. In case of an unsuccessful roll, all previously set aside dice do not count. So, it's worth thinking carefully before rolling again.  
  
The concept of the game was based on the dice game from **Kingdom Come: Deliverance**, so all the rules and combinations were taken from there as well.  
  

## **How to play:**

To play with an innkeeper, simply talk to them and select the appropriate option in the dialogue:
